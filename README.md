# Playlist_Remixer
A song is a reflection of the artists ego. I hypothesize that someone who consistently adds to a playlist
songs that they find aurally pleasing create a time series of egoic reflections. I believe this time series
can be processed and then displayed in certain ways that allow the playlist creator to reflect with an added dimension
on their past. This model should only be able to be understood in its entirety by the playlist creator, but ranges
of it could be understood by people in parallel mindsets.
