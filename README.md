# Playlist_Remixer
This repository allows you to remix your Spotify playlist into a new playlist depending on certain song attributes that you can select. It also visualizes listening habits with a histogram and a list of averaged song statistics that varies by day. Lyrics are collected from genius.com and will be used for sentiment analysis and further feature gathering in the future.
